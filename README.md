Introduction to Virtual Machines and Setup Guide for Ubuntu

1. What is a Virtual Machine (VM)?

A Virtual Machine (VM) is a software-based computer that runs inside your actual computer.
It allows you to:

- Create a safe, isolated environment for experiments

- Install operating systems (like Ubuntu Linux) without changing your main computer

- Practice programming, bioinformatics, or system administration

- Reset or delete the environment at any time without consequences

In this part, we will use VMware Workstation 17 Player to create a VM running Ubuntu 22.04, where we will install R, RStudio, and the Biostrings package for sequence analysis.
